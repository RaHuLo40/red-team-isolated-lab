# red-team-isolated-lab
A fully isolated cybersecurity home lab for red team practice using Kali, Parrot OS, and Metasploitable2.

# Red Team Cybersecurity Home Lab

This repository documents the design, setup, and isolation of a personal **cybersecurity home lab** built for **red team / offensive security practice**.

The lab is intentionally **fully isolated** to ensure safe exploitation of vulnerable systems without risking the host machine or external networks.

This project focuses on:
- Secure lab design
- Network isolation
- Ethical hacking environment setup
- Hands-on red team learning

---

## 🎯 Objectives of This Lab

- Build a **realistic red team practice environment**
- Safely attack vulnerable machines in an **isolated network**
- Learn attacker methodologies using industry-standard tools
- Document everything clearly for **learning and portfolio purposes**

---
